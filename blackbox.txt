You are trying to to daemonize an unknown, black-box binary executable. The binary executable returns no output to STDOUT or STDERR. Assume that the mystery binary return code is non-zero. What troubleshooting steps might you take to learn more about what the binary is supposed to do, and why it is failing?



1. Strace
1. LD_PRELOAD to replace certain libraries and API calls
1. System logs
1. Exit code can be a sign
1. (unlikely to help) go on with GDB
1. Enivornment variables
1. 32bit vs 64bit
1. Library and kernel versions
1. A specific device is required
1. Hardcoded paths and/or executable name
